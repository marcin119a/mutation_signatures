### Detecting relevant signatures in Cancer with a bootstrap approach. 

We are pleased to announce significant updates to our research methodology and analytical tools. 
Our pivotal model, originally implemented in "Detecting Presence of Mutational Signatures in Cancer with Confidence,"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29028923/, originally developed in R language, has now been rewritten in Python. 


## Model Selection Enhancement:
In parallel with the rewrite, we have refined our model selection process. 
Drawing inspiration from the backward elimination procedure commonly employed in linear regression analysis, we have developed a bespoke model selection framework tailored to the nuances of mutational signature detection using a bootstrap method based on the computational p-value. 
This enhanced approach allows for more precise identification of relevant signatures, ensuring that our models are both important and not important.

Our updated model selection methodology optimizes the balance between model complexity and explanatory power.
